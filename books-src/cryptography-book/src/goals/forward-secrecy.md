# Forward secrecy

aka perfect forward secrecy

Secrecy of past data is preserved into the future ("forward"), even if a long-term private key (in a key agreement protocol) is compromised.

In layman's terms, having forward secrecy means you cannot see previously encrypted data. 

Note that this is a feature in key agreement protocols.
