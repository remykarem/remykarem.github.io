# Block ciphers

A **deterministic** encryption algorithm operating on blocks.

```admonish note
A **block** is a fixed-length group of bits.
```

The algorithm should be able to perform both operations:

$$
\text{(message, \textbf{key})} \rightarrow \text{ciphertext}
$$

$$
\text{(ciphertext, \textbf{key})} \rightarrow \text{message}
$$
