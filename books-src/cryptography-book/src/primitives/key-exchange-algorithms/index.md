# Key exchange

In key exchange protocols, _both parties_ contribute to the negotiation of a **shared secret**.

This shared secret can be used for encryption, typically [block ciphers](../encryption-algorithms/block-ciphers/index.md) or stream ciphers.

In a key exchange algorithm, each party must have a private and public key respectively.

~~~admonish example title="Use case"
A common use case for key exchange algorithms is to establish a secure channel for communication.
