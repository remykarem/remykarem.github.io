# Key strength

The strength of the cryptographic keys is highly correlated with the key length. Different organisations (academic, public and private) have different recommendations based on their methodologies.

NIST has its own set of recommendations published in May 2020 [Recommendation for Key Management: Part 1 â€“ General](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/57/pt1/r5/final).

For an overview of the different recommendations, see [Cryptographic Key Length Recommendation](https://www.keylength.com).
