# PGP key

Anatomy of a PGP key:
* a key pair
* a User ID
* subkeys — secondary key pairs that can be used for signing, encryption.
* expiration date
* ...

There are usually 2 key pairs involved when you generate a "PGP key pair":
1. an `[SC]` key
2. an `[E]` key

* `S` — signing
* `C` — certifying (verifying)
* `E` — encrypting
