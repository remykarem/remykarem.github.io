# DoS / DDoS

Denial of Service / Distributed Denial of Service

In a DoS attack, an attacker floods a system with unnecessary requests in order to overload the system's resources **so that it cannot respond to regular traffic**.

This flood of messages essentially forces it to shut down, thereby denying service to the legitimate users.

A DDoS attack is similar to DoS but is carried out from multiple devices.
