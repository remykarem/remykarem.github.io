# Indexing

The DBMS ensures that the contents of the table and the index are logically in sync. Note that primary keys are always indexed.

Indexes are used for:
* point lookup
* range lookup
* prefix search
* geo-location lookup

Two types of indices:

* **Ordered indices - B+ tree (common)**
* Hash indices - Hash table
