# Field

A field $\mathbb{F}$ is a commutative ring (?).

|                | Addition | Multiplication^ |
|----------------|----------|----------------|
| Closure        | ✅       | ✅             |
| Associativity  | ✅       | ✅             |
| Identity       | ✅       | ✅             |
| Invertibility  | ✅       | ✅             |
| Commutativity  | ✅       | ✅             |
| Distributivity | -        | ✅             |

^Only the non-zero elements of a field form a commutative group under multiplication.

A field can be **finite** or **infinite**. **Finite fields** are also called **Galois fields**.

```admonish note
A ring $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is a field if and only if the modulus $n$ is prime.
```

The order of a finite field is always a *prime power*.
