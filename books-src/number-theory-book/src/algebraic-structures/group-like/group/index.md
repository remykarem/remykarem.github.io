# Groups

A **group** $\mathbb{G}$ is a set of elements that follows the following rules:

|               | Binary operation |
|---------------|------------------|
| Closure       | ✅               |
| Associativity | ✅               |
| Identity      | ✅               |
| Invertibility | ✅               |
| Commutativity |                  |

The number of elements of the group, $|\mathbb{G}|$, is known as the **order of the group**.

Groups may have:

* generators — a group can have either several or no generators.
* subgroups

Given a group $\mathbb{G}$ and a subgroup $\mathbb{H}$, the **cofactor** or **index of the subgroup** is the ratio $\frac{|\mathbb{G}|}{|\mathbb{H}|}$

Groups can be:

* finite or infinite
* **cyclic** — if a group has generator(s)

Elements of a group can:
* repeat
* have an **element order**
