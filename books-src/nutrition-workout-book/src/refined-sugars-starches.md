# Refined sugars and starches

* Rapid blood sugar spikes & insulin response

  Repeated spikes can contribute to insulin resistance

* Poor in nutrients

  If this is the diet, then it might lead to nutrient deficiencies

* Effect on satiety and overeating

  Blood sugar can crash soon after spike, which leaves you hungry again, promoting overeating and cravings.

* **Oxidative stress**

  Studies show that even a single high-glucose meal increases markers of oxidative stress.

  1. Blood sugar spike accelerates mitochondrial metabolism in cells, particularly endothelial cells and immune cells.
  2. The overflow of electrons in mitochondria generates more ROS, tipping the balance between oxidants and antioxidants.
  3. High circulating glucose promotes formation of AGEs, which bind to RAGE receptors, which stimulate further ROS production.

* Gut health

  If this is the diet, then it will lead to a less diverse gut microbiome, associated with inflammation and metabolic issues.
