# Fried food

Why is fried food so bad?

* **Fat oxidation** — lipid peroxides, aldehydes, trans fat can increase oxidative stress
* **Calorie dense** — Because of oil absorption especially with batter
* **Advanced Glycation End Products** — Frying causes proteins and sugars in food to react, forming AGEs.
* Low in nutrients (because of refined oil) — decrease in neutralisation of ROS
* **Reuse** — oil in deep fried foods are usually reused, increase fat oxidation

How is oil refined?
* Extract (high heat, oxygen)
* Degum (?)
* Neutralise
* Bleach — to remove colour
* Deodorise — high heat
* Hydrogenate — increase shelf life

Why is refining oils not so great?
* May contain **oxidised PUFAs**
* Strips natural **antioxidants** like Vitamin E
* May contain residual solvents

~~~admonish warning
10 minutes of deep frying reduces concentration of linoleic acid by 20%, indicating heavy oxidation.

In reused frying oils, oxidation products can rise by 200–300% compared to fresh oil.
