# Inflammation

* Acute — caused by injury, infection, irritants
* Chronic — ongoing low-level irritants, poor lifestyle, autoimmune issues

Examples:
* **Muscle repair after exercise** → Microtears trigger a mild inflammatory response to build stronger muscle.
* **Clearing dead cells** → The immune system uses inflammation to remove old or damaged cells.
* Barrier maintenance 

Diet-related:
* **Blood sugar spike**

    Cells overloaded with glucose generate ROS, which damage DNA, proteins etc, which the body treats as an injury.

* **Trans fats and saturated fats**

    Trans fat directly activate immune cells and promote inflammation.

* **Overeating/caloric excess**

    1. fat cells enlarge and become dysfunctional
    2. They attract macrophages (immune cells) to clean up dying fat cells
    3. Macrophages + fat cells together form an inflamed mini-environment
