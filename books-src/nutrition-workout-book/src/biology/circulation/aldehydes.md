-CHO, can be reactive

Effects of *unstable* aldehydes:
* **Cytotoxic** — reacts with proteins; disrupts cell membranes
* **Genotoxic** — Form adducts in proteins and DNA, causing mutation
* **Pro-inflammatory** — Promote pro-inflammatory pathways

Examples:
* 4-HNE — from fat oxidation
* MDA — from fat oxidation
* Vanillin — vanilla beans
* Cinnamaldehyde — cinnamon
* Benzaldehyde — almonds
* Acetaldehyde — from alcohol metabolism
* Formaldehyde — from metabolism, environment

Human biomarker studies have shown that individuals with a high intake of fried foods exhibit elevated levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE)-adducted proteins in their urine. This suggests that fried food consumption is associated with increased lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress.[^biomarkerstudy]
