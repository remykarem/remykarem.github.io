# Free radicals

## ROS

ROS is a type of free radical. Excess of ROS is called **oxidative stress**.

ROS examples:
* Superoxide anion (O₂⁻)
* Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂)
* Hydroxyl radical (•OH)
* Singlet oxygen (¹O₂)

Roles:
* Immune response — white blood cells produce ROS to kill bacteria and viruses
* Cell signalling
* Wound healing

Sources:
* **Metabolism** during ATP production
* **Immune cells** during infection
* **Environment sources** — UV light, cigarette smoke
* **Diet**
    * **Fried and deep fried sources**
    * Processed and cured meats — bacon, sausages, hot dogs, deli meats
    * High sugar — glycation; AGE
    * **Red meat**
    * Alcohol
    * Trans fats & refined oils

ROS can be counteracted with **antioxidants**.
