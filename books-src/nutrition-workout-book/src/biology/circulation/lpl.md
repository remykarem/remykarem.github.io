# LPL

Lipoprotein Lipase

LPL is _bound to_ blood vessels in the wall instead of in circulation.

LPL hydrolyses triglycerides in VLDL and chylomicrons, releasing [FFAs](./ffas.md) and [glycerol](./glycerol.md).

Some studies have shown that unsaturated fats increase LPL activity than saturated fats.

In other words, it's easier for the body to break down unsaturated fats.
