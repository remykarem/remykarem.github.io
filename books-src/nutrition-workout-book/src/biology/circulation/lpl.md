# LPL

Lipoprotein Lipase

LPL is _bound to_ blood vessels in the wall instead of in circulation.

LPL hydrolyses triglycerides in VLDL and chylomicrons, releasing [FFAs](./ffas.md) and [glycerol](./glycerol.md).

~~~admonish
Some studies have shown that LPL activity is increased for unsaturated fats than saturated fats.
