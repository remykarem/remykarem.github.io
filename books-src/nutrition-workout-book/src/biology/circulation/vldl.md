# VLDL

Very Low-Density Lipoprotein

Precursor: ApoB-100

Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) on capillaries, especially in adipose and muscle tissue, hydrolyse the triglycerides. THe fatty acids go into tissues for storage or energy.

As VLDL loses triglycerides, it becomes IDL (Intermediate-Density Lipoprotein), then eventually LDL, which delivers cholesterol to cells.
