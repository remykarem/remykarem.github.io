# HDL

High-Density Lipoprotein

* The ApoA1
  * Binds to ABCA1 transporter of cells, which will trigger movement of cholesterol from cell to HDL
  * Activates LCAT, which converts cholesterol into cholesteryl ester (more hydrophobic), which will result move the cholesterol to the core of the HDL particle
* Interacts with VLDL/LDL by exchanging cholesteryl esters for triglycerides via CETP.

~~~admonish tip
EPA and DHA (Omega-3 fatty acids) increase the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 genes in cells, which means more cholesterol is pumped out to HDL.
