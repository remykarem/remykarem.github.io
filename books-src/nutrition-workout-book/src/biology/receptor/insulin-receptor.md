# Insulin receptor

When insulin binds to the receptor, it triggers a cascade of signals inside the cell to **open up glucose channels** to let sugar in.

Most active and critical in:
* Muscle cells
* Fat cells
* Liver cells

Other cells:
* Brain
* Kidney

## Pathway

1. Insulin binds to the receptor.
2. ...
3. ...
4. Akt activation.
5. GLUT4, a glucose transporter, moves to the cell membrane.
6. Glucose enters the cell.

## What caused this pathway be dysfunctional?

* Too much ectopic fat inside cells

~~~admonish warning title="Saturated fats"
Saturated fats can impair the insulin pathway.

The fat gets converted into lipid intermediates that actively interfere with insulin signalling:
* blocks insulin receptor
* inhibit Akt
