# Insulin receptor

When insulin binds to the receptor, 

Muscles
* Convert glucose to ATP
* Store glucose as glycogen (if abundant)

Fat cells
* Convert glucose to ATP
* Excess glucose is converted to fatty acids and triglycerides
* Inhibits lipolysis (fat breakdown)

Liver
* Inhibits gluconeogenesis (new glucose production)
* Inhibits glycogenolysis (glycogen breakdown into glucose)
