# Liver

Cholesterol production is highest overnight.

## Receptors

- [Insulin receptor]()
- [Glucagon receptor]()
- [LDL Receptor]()
- [LDL Receptor-Related Protein 1 (LRP1)]()
- [SR-BI]()

## Functions

### Storage

Glycogen, vitamins, cholesteryl esters

Excess glucose is stored as glycogen. But the liver only stores up to about 100g of glycogen. After that, the liver converts glucose into fatty acids ("**lipogenesis**"). This may be stored in the liver, or get sent out into the blood as triglycerides.

Cholesterol can also be stored. They are esterified into cholesteryl esters.

~~~admonish tip="How long can it last?"
Glycogen storage can last for about 12-18h of fasting.

### Detoxification

### Metabolism

* Insulin receptor
* Glucagon receptor

### Bile acid production

Bile acids is used to digest fats. Converted from cholesterol via an enzyme. 

### Cholesterol production

Has an enzyme HMG CoA reductase required for mevalonate pathway.

### Cholesterol elimination

Some cholesterol is secreted into bile directly, which will get removed from the body.

### VLDL production

The liver packages
* triglycerides — from excess glucose and free fatty acids
* cholesterol 

into VLDL, which is released into the bloodstream.

### HDL production

The liver synthesises _nascent HDL_ which consists of Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) and phospholipids, and very little cholesterol.

HDL production increases 
* as ApoA1 increases (rate-limiter),
* which happens when ApoA1 gene expression goes up,
* which happens when AMPK is activated in liver cells,
* which happen when there is low ATP,
* which happens when there's low blood glucose or fasting or exercise or low insulin.

## PPAR-α

Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Alpha; a nuclear receptor in liver cells

PPAR-α increases the transcription of genes involved in lipid metabolism, including apoA-I.

~~~admonish tip title="Ligands"
MUFAs & PUFAs can bind to PPAR-α; activation is stronger with PUFAs.
