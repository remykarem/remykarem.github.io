# Liver

## Receptors

- [Insulin receptor]()
- [Glucagon receptor]()
- [LDL Receptor]()
- [LDL Receptor-Related Protein 1 (LRP1)]()

## Functions

### Storage

Glycogen, vitamins, cholesteryl esters

Excess glucose is stored as glycogen. But the liver only stores up to about 100g of glycogen. After that, the liver converts glucose into fatty acids ("**lipogenesis**"). This may be stored in the liver, or get sent out into the blood as triglycerides.

Cholesterol can also be stored. They are esterified into cholesteryl esters.

### Detoxification

### Metabolism

* Insulin receptor
* Glucagon receptor

### Bile acid production

Bile acids is used to digest fats. Converted from cholesterol via an enzyme. 

### Cholesterol elimination

Some cholesterol is secreted into bile directly, which will get removed from the body.

### Cholesterol management

Detects and controls cholesterol levels. Has LDL receptors.

Makes cholesterols.

* HDL — as ApoA1 protein
* VLDL — The liver packages excess triglycerides _and_ cholesterol from what it made or food. Shipped to the rest of the body to transport fat and cholesterol to tissues. As VLDL loses triglycerides, it eventually becomes LDL.

Has an enzyme HMG CoA reductase.

HDL production increases as ApoA1 increases,
* which happens when ApoA1 gene expression goes up,
* which happens when AMPK is activated in liver cells,
* which happen when there is low ATP,
* which happens when there's low blood glucose or fasting or exercise or low insulin. 

Cholesterol production is highest overnight.
