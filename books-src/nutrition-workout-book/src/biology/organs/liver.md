# Liver

Detects and controls cholesterol levels.

Makes cholesterols.

* HDL — as ApoA1 protein
* VLDL — packages excess triglycerides _and_ cholesterol from what it made or food. Shipped to the rest if the body. 

VLDL eventually becomes LDL.

Has an enzyme HMG CoA reductase.

HDL production increases as ApoA1 increases,
which happens when ApoA1 gene expression goes up,
which happens when AMPK is activated in liver cells,
which happen when there is low ATP,
which happens when there's low blood glucose or fasting or exercise or low insulin.
