# Muscles

Muscle tissue is the most efficient and the largest site of glucose uptake in the body.

Muscles that exercise often become better at handling fats â€” they store a little, burn a lot, and stay insulin sensitive.
Muscles that sit idle store fats badly, create toxic messes, and become insulin resistant.

## Muscle contraction

Muscle contraction trigger a signal that causes GLUT4 transporters to move to the surface of the cell (to take in glucose) _without requiring insulin_.

## Calories burned

Every kg of muscle at rest burns 10-15 kcal per day[^1]. 

## Fat oxidation

Fatty acids are broken down to produce energy (ATP), primarily during aerobic activity.

* Muscle activity lowers ATP and raises AMPK
* AMPK signals to use fat storage + increase LPL production
* LPL enzymes sent to the capillary walls
* LPL break down triglycerides from passing VLDL and chylomicrons into free fatty acids.
* Fatty acids are pulled into the muscle and burned for energy or stored briefly.

Insulin suppresses LPL activity.

~~~admonish tip
Exercise in a fasted or low-insulin state (e.g. before breakfast or hours after eating) helps your muscles use more fat.

## Trained muscles

Trained muscle tissues upregulate fat oxidation.
