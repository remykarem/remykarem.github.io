# Fiber

Not a source of energy; slows digestion

Properties:
* Non-digestible

## Soluble fiber
Dissolves in water to form a gel.
1. The gel slows the rate at which food leaves the stomach and into the small intestine.
2. Traps the nutrients, such that they diffuse more slowly through the gel towards the intestinal wall.

Properties:
* Fermentable

~~~admonish tip title="Fermentable"
Broken down by gut bacteria (in large intestine).

The by-products can nourish colon cells and reduce inflammation.
~~~

~~~admonish tip title="Prebiotic"
Soluble fibers are generally considered prebiotic because they promote the growth of beneficial intestinal microorganisms.
~~~

Examples:

* Beta-glucan — prebiotic; mild potency

    ~~~

* Pectin
    Examples: apples, citrus fruits

* Inulin — potent prebiotic

    Examples: onions, garlic

* Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) — potent prebiotic
* Galactooligosaccharides (GOS) — potent prebiotic


### Food sources

## Insoluble fiber

Adds bulk to the stool, and helps food pass more quickly theough the stomach and intestines. 

Properties:
* Insoluble — doesn't dissolve in water, but absorbs water and swells.
