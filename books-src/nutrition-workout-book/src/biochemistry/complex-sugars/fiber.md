# Fiber

Not a source of energy; slows digestion

Properties:
* Non-digestible

## Soluble fiber
Dissolves in water to form a gel.
1. The gel slows the rate at which food leaves the stomach and into the small intestine.
2. Traps the nutrients, such that they diffuse more slowly through the gel towards the intestinal wall.

Properties:
* Fermentable

~~~admonish tip title="Fermentable"
Broken down by gut bacteria (in large intestine).

The by-products can nourish colon cells and reduce inflammation.
~~~

~~~admonish tip title="Prebiotic"
Soluble fibers are generally considered prebiotic because they promote the growth of beneficial intestinal microorganisms.
~~~

Examples:

* Inulin — potent prebiotic

* Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) — potent prebiotic; food sources often overlap with inulin
 
* Galactooligosaccharides (GOS) — potent prebiotic; may cause bloatedness

* Beta-glucan — prebiotic; mild potency; has cholesterol-lowering effect[^quaker]

* Pectin — mild potency prebiotic; some bacteria can ferment; helps with stool consistency

* Psyllium — pporly fermented

### Food sources

* Fruits
  * Banana — FOS, inulin (underripe)
  * Citrus fruits — pectin
  * Apples — pectin
  * Kiwi — pectin
* Greens
  * **Garlic** — inulin, FOS
  * **Onions** — inulin, FOS
  * Asparagus — inulin, FOS
* Grains
  * **Oats** — beta-glucan
  * Barley
* Fungi
  * Mushrooms — beta-glucan
* Nuts/beans
  * Chickpeas — GOS
  * Kidney beans — GOS
  * **Soybeans**
  * Lentils

## Insoluble fiber

Adds bulk to the stool, and helps food pass more quickly theough the stomach and intestines. 

Properties:
* Insoluble — doesn't dissolve in water, but absorbs water and swells. 
* Less fermentable
