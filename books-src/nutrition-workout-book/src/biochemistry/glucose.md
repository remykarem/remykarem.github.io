~~~admonish warning title="What happens if excess?"

1) **High LDL** Excess sugar is stored as glycogen in liver and muscles. After these stores are full (depending on muscle size too), excess sugar is converted to VLDL, which eventually turns into LDL. (pretty normal)

2) **Diabetes** Insulin resistance, leading to pancreas overwork, leading to damaged pancreas

3) Blood vessels damage; inflammation; oxidative stress
