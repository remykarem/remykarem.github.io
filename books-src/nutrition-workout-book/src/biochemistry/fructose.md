# Fructose 

## Food sources

Fruits (small), sugary drinks

## Biology

Metabolised by liver only

Purpose: Energy (as glucose) or storage (glycogen or LDL)

Excess sugar is stored as glycogen in liver only. After this store is full, excess sugar is converted to VLDL, which eventually turns into LDL. (pretty normal)
