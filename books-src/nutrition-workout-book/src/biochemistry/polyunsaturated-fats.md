"Poly" refers to the multiple double bonds.

Can lower LDL and raise HDL

Polyunsaturated fatty acids inhibit HMG-CoA reductase activity[^hmgcoareductase]

~~~admonish tip title="Omega-k"
Omega-k refers to the position of the first double bond at the kth carbon.

## Chemical processes

### Oxidation

PUFAs are sensitive to heat, light, and oxygen.

PUFA + O2 -> Oxidised PUFA + lipid peroxides

Oxidized PUFAs contain harmful lipid peroxides, aldehydes (like 4-HNE, MDA), and free radicals.

~~~admonish tip title="Vitamin E in foods"
Vitamin E, found in almonds and walnuts etc. acts as a potent antioxidant that protect the PUFA from oxidation.
~~~

~~~admonish warning title= "Insulin resistance"
Lipid peroxides can generate ROS upon degradation.

ROS impairs insulin pathways in muscle and liver cells. 
~~~

~~~admonish warning title="Genotoxic, cytotoxic"
4-HNE and MDA can form adducts with DNA and proteins, which may lead to mutations, cell dysfunction, and even cancer in the long term .

### Polymerisation

Oxidised PUFA -> Polymer

### Isomerisation

Cis PUFA -> Trans PUFA

### Hydrolysis

PUFA + water + heat -> FFAs + glycerol

## Common PUFAs

* Omega-3 — 3-6 double bonds

    * ALA (plant-based)
    * DHA (animal-based)
    * EPA (animal-based)

* Omega-6

    * Linoleic acid — 2 double bonds

## Top foods

* Nuts
    * **Walnuts** (47g) — mostly ALA
    * Pecans (21g) — mostly linoleic acid
    * **Almonds** (12g) — mostly linoleic acid

* Seeds
    * **Chia seeds** (31g) — mostly ALA
    * Flaxseeds (29g) — mostly linoleic acid
    * Sunflower seeds (23g) — mostly linoleic acid
    * **Tofu** (2g)
* Oils — linoleic acid
  * **Sunflower oil** (230°C)
  * **Corn oil**
  * **Canola oil** — mostly 
  * **other vegetable oils**
* Animals
    * **Salmon** (2g) — mostly EPA/DHA
    * Mackerel (2g) — mostly EPA/DHA
    * Egg (1g) — mostly linoleic acid

## Biology

PUFAs are essential fatty acids — the body can't make them on its own.

Found in high amounts in the brain.
