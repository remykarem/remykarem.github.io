## Saturated fatty acids

Found typically in animal products and tropical plant oils

* **Palmitic acid** — meat, dairy, palm oil, butter, cocoa butter, ghee, lard, tallow
* **Myristic acid** — nutmeg, palm oil, coconut oil, and dairy fat
* **Stearic acid** — meat, dairy, cocoa butter, dark chocolate, tallow

  The body converts it into oleic acid
  
* **Lauric acid** — coconut oil
* MCTs — coconut oil
* Fully hydrogenated oils — Processed foods, shelf-stable baked goods
* Interesterified fats — Margarine, shortening, baked goods

## Food sources

* Chicken (without skin):
  1. Wing (2.1g)
  2. Thigh (1.3g)
  3. Drumstick (1g)
  4. Breast (0.4g)
* Beef:

  2. Short rib (8g)
  3. Tenderloin (4g)
  4. Sirloin (3g)

## Biology

* Palmitic acid, myristic acid and lauric acid raise your cholesterol[^only3]
* Lauric acid —  a large portion of its effect is on HDL rather than LDL[^only3]
