There are 9 "essential" amino acids:
1. Leucine
2. Isoleucine
3. Valine
4. Tryptophan

"Essential" because the human body cannot produce on its own, but are essential for various bodily functions like protein synthesis, tissue repair, and nutrient absorption.

~~~admonish tip
Leucine, isoleucine and valine bypass the liver.
