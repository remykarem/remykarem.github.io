# Retinoids

A class of compounds derived from Vitamin A.

* Stimulates **collagen** production — binds to retinoic acid receptors in skin cells
    * Turn on genes involved in collagen synthesis
    * Inhibit enzymes called MMPS that degrade collagen
* May reduce melanin synthesis

    ~~~admonish warning
    This will increase skin's UV sensitivity.
    ~~~

Active forms:
* **Retinoic acid**

    Retinyl palmitate -> Retinol -> Retinaldehyde (retinal) -> Retinoic acid

* **Adapelene** — not a direct Vitamin A analog

    Binds to fewer receptors than retinoic acid does
