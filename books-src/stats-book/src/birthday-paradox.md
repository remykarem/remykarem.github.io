# Birthday paradox

The birthday paradox observes that in a room of just 23 people, thereâ€™s a roughly 50% chance that two people will share the same birthday. This seems counterintuitive because there are 365 days in a year, but the probability of a shared birthday increases rapidly with each new person added.
