# Purchase-to-order

While there exists uncertainty in a purchase-to-order, it is permissible based on a hadeeth[^purchasetoorder].

---

[^purchasetoorder]: Ibn Abbas ra reported that when Allah's prophet pbuh came to Medina, they were paying one and two years in advance for fruits, so he said: Those who pay in advance for anything must do so for a specified weight and for a definite time.
