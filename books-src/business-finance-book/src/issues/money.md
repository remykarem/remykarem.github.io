~~~admonish tip title="My take"
Fiat money to me has monetary value.

The monetary value of something is subjective, even gold.

But it is also authoritative, depending on where you live. You basically can't choose whether it has value or not. You live in a country that accepts printable paper money to have monetary value, you go with it.

[^legaltender]: Legal tender is any form of currency that a government officially recognizes as valid for settling debts and making payments for goods and services within a country. In essence, it's the money that a country's laws say must be accepted as payment. While it's typically physical cash like coins and banknotes, it can also include digital currencies in some cases.
