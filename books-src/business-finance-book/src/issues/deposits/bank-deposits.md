~~~admonish tip title="My take"
Bank deposits nowadays don't function as deposits per se. 

They're not really "borrowing money" from you, because imo we're the one initiating it. But in conventional finance, it's legally a loan. The bank guarantees (i) the principle and (ii) the interest. If I take this view, then imo it's permissible.

They should be treated as "investments" because it is common knowledge that banks use the money for other purposes. Is Islamic Banking, savings accounts are usually structured as profit-sharing agreement (mudharaba).
