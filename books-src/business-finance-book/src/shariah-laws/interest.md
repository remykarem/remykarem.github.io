# Interest

Allah has permitted trade and forbidden riba (interest)[^1]

Agreeing to a riba in contract is problematic because you are implicated. borrower, lender, writer, witnesses[^3]

[^1]: Surah Al-Baqarah 2:275

[^2]: Gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, salt for salt â€” equal for equal, same for same, hand to hand. If they differ, then sell as you wish, provided it is hand to hand. (Sahih Muslim 1587, also in Bukhari)

[^3]: The Messenger of Allah cursed the one who consumes riba, the one who pays it, the one who records it, and the two witnesses to it, and he said: They are all the same.
Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1598
