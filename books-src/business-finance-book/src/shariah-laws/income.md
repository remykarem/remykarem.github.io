# Income

Earning income, as opposed to receiving it, has its virtues[^firewood] [^ownhand].

Seeking halal income is an obligation for every Muslim[^halalearnings] and has its merits[^dua].

[^firewood]: It is better for one of you to gather firewood and carry it on his back thank to ask someone who may give or may refuse. (???)

[^ownhand]: No one ever ate any food better than that which he earned with his own hands. And the Prophet of Allah, Dawud, peace be upon him, used to eat from what he earned with his own hand. (???)

[^halalearnings]: Seeking halal earnings is an obligation upon every Muslim. (???)

[^dua]: But his food is haram, his drink from haram, and his clothing from haram. How then can his dua be accepted? (???)
