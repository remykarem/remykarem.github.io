# Gambling

"O you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling (maysir), sacrificing to stones, and divining arrows are an abomination of Satan’s handiwork. Avoid it so that you may succeed."
(Qur’an 5:90)

~~~admonish note
Whoever says to another: ‘Come, let us gamble,’ must give charity.

Sahih Bukhari
~~~

While there is **risk**, **uncertainty** and **hope for profit**, gambling is a zero-sum game.
