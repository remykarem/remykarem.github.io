#### On being wealthy

It's okay to be wealthy[^companions] [^confirmed].

In fact, being wealthy is a grace[^grace] and opens doors to many opportunities for good deeds[^grace], but that comes with accountability[^reckoning1] [^reckoning2].

If given a choice, being wealthy could be a better option[^upperhand].

It makes you a strong Muslim[^strongmuslim] financially.

#### On greed for wealth

Having more wealth is usually associated with greed. But if you put your money in your hand, not your heart[^moneyinhand], then you have greater control.

#### On managing finances well

We're encouraged to maintain:
* a balanced spending[^balanced], and
* entrust our finances to the right people[^entrust].

#### On legacy planning

We're also encouraged to plan the finances for dependents and for our death[^dependents].

#### On growing money

If a lot of money that we have is just getting "taxed", then it might be good to invest it instead.[^reducedwealth]

Salman Al-farisi divides his wealth into 3 parts, one of it is investments.[^salmanalfarisi]
