# Riba in loans

Riba al-qardh

Excess compensation in a loan

Usury is haram[^1] [^2] and involvement in it is complicit[^3]. It is one of the major sins.[^majorsins]

~~~admonish note title="Pre-Islamic Arabic"
In pre-Islamic Arabia, riba al-qardh was a common practice where lender would exploit borrowers by c harging exorbitant interest on loans.[^lecturenotes1]

If the borrower was unable to repay the principal and the interest on time, the lender woujld extend the loan term but increase the interest, often leading to a cycle of debt and financial ruin for the borrower.[^lecturenotes1]

Riba in its historical context involved doubling and redoubling debts on borrowers who were unable to repay.[^lecturenotes1] This is mentioned in the Quran[^doubling].
