Usury is haram[^1] and involvement in it is complicit[^2].

## questions

* Riba is only twice the amount and above based on 3:130?

[^1]: Allah permitted commerce, and He prohibited usury. (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:275)

[^3]: Gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, salt for salt â€” equal for equal, same for same, hand to hand. If they differ, then sell as you wish, provided it is hand to hand. (Sahih Muslim 1587, also in Bukhari)

[^2]: The Messenger of Allah cursed the one who consumes riba, the one who pays it, the one who records it, and the two witnesses to it, and he said: They are all the same. (Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1598)
