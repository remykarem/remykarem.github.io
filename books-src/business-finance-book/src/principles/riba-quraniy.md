# Riba in loans

Riba al-qardh

Usury is haram[^1] [^2] and involvement in it is complicit[^3].

~~~admonish note title="Pre-Islamic Arabic"
In pre-Islamic Arabia, riba al-qardh was a common practice where lender would exploit borrowers by c harging exorbitant interest on loans.[^lecturenotes1]

If the borrower was unable to repay the principal and the interest on time, the lender woujld extend the loan term but increase the interest, often leading to a cycle of debt and financial ruin for the borrower.[^lecturenotes1]

Riba in its historical context involved doubling and redoubling debts on borrowers who were unable to repay.[^lecturenotes1] This is mentioned in the Quran[^doubling].

[^1]: Allah permitted commerce, and He prohibited usury. (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:275)

[^2]: But if you do not (cease from usury), then be warned of war from Allah and His messenger. However, if you repent, you may retain your principal â€” neither inflicting nor suffering harm. (Quran Al-Baqarah:279)

[^3]: The Messenger of Allah cursed the one who consumes riba, the one who pays it, the one who records it, and the two witnesses to it, and he said: They are all the same. (Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1598)

[^lecturenotes1]: Based on lecture notes.

[^doubling]: O you who have believed, do not consume usury, doubled and multiplied, but fear Allah that you may be successful.
