# Gambling

Gambling is haram[^gambling]. Suggesting it requires purification[^purify].

Characteristics:
* **Money/assets** at stake
* Outcome depends on luck
* Zero-sum nature
* Lack of certainty (gharar)
* No real economic value added

## Money stake

Zero-sum ness

## Chance, skill, control of outcome

It's not about anything that involves chance or the use of dice per se. because drawing lots was a thing previously and was practiced. 

~~~admonish example title="Lucky draw"
Paying to enter a lucky draw is similar to gambling.

## Winning or losing

It's not about anything that has a winner and loser.

There is no [monetary] competition except in archery, camel racing, or horse racing.

From chatgpt
— Sunan Abu Dawood 2574, Sahih by al-Albani


~~~admonish note title="Me on day trading"
I am buying a lot of shares today, then I'll sell my shares the second i see the price is climbing so that I can profit a lot.

[^gambling]: "O you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling (maysir), sacrificing to stones, and divining arrows are an abomination of Satan’s handiwork. Avoid it so that you may succeed." (Quran Al-Maedah:90)

[^purify]: Whoever says to another: ‘Come, let us gamble,’ must give charity.
