[^legaltender]: Legal tender is any form of currency that a government officially recognizes as valid for settling debts and making payments for goods and services within a country. In essence, it's the money that a country's laws say must be accepted as payment. While it's typically physical cash like coins and banknotes, it can also include digital currencies in some cases.
