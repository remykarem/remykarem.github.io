* Make a stand
* If you haven't made a stand, look at how it is beneficial

* Empathy
* Avoid getting manipulated by people

Questions

* No one knows the truth
* Can I have my own take on it?

Methodology:
1. Quran
2. Hadeeth
3. Consensus of scholars
4. Logical reasoning

Others

* Fiqh is to solve problem, not judge

[^subjected]: Have you not seen that Allah has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth? (Quran Luqman:20)

[^silent]: And He remained silent about some matters out of mercy for you, so do not seek after them.
