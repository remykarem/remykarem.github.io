# Fiqh, opinions

The default ruling (agreed upon majority of scholars) is permissibility[^subjected] [^silent].

* Make a stand
* If you haven't made a stand, look at how it is beneficial
* Bring ease, not hardship

Why understand different opinions?
* Empathy
* Avoid getting manipulated by people

Questions
* Is it about can or cannot?
* No one knows the truth
* Can I have my own take on it?

Methodology:
1. Quran
2. Hadeeth
3. Consensus of scholars
4. Logical reasoning (qiyas)

Others
* Guidance, not judgement
* Fiqh is to solve problem, not judge
* Need
* Some good in difference in opinion
* Not about choosing the easiest, but choosing something that depends on you
* Anything that itâ€™s too restrictive, relax, anything too relax, restrict

[^subjected]: Have you not seen that Allah has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth? (Quran Luqman:20)

[^silent]: And He remained silent about some matters out of mercy for you, so do not seek after them.
