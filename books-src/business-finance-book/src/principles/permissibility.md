# Fiqh, opinions

The default ruling (agreed upon majority of scholars) is permissibility[^subjected] [^silent].

Why understand different opinions?
* Empathy
* Avoid getting manipulated by people

Questions
* Is it about can or cannot?
* No one knows the truth
* Can I have my own take on it?

Methodology:
1. Quran
2. Hadeeth
3. Consensus of scholars
4. Logical reasoning (qiyas)


Fiqh Maxims / Legal Principles:
* Necessities permit forbidden things.[^necessities]

  الصِّرُورَات تُبِيحُ المَحْطُورَات

* A strong need, even if not reaching the level of absolute necessity, is given the same legal ruling as necessity — whether the need is general for the community or specific to an individual.[^strongneed]

  حاجة تنزل منزلة الضرورة عامة كانت أو خاصة


Commonly discussed among scholars:
* Some good in difference in opinion
* Not about choosing the easiest, but choosing something that depends on you
* Anything that it’s too restrictive, relax, anything too relax, restrict

Others
* Guidance, not judgement
* Fiqh is to solve problem, not judge
* Make a stand
* If you haven't made a stand, look at how it is beneficial
* Bring ease, not hardship
* Never say exclusively that someone's action (even yours) is haram.
* Knowledge matters
