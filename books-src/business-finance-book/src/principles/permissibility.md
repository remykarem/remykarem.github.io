# Permissibility

The default ruling (agreed upon majority of scholars) is permissibility[^subjected] [^silent].

---

[^subjected]: Have you not seen that Allah has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth? (Quran Luqman:20)

[^silent]: And He remained silent about some matters out of mercy for you, so do not seek after them.
