[^halalearnings]: Seeking halal earnings is an obligation upon every Muslim. (???)

[^dua]: But his food is haram, his drink from haram, and his clothing from haram. How then can his dua be accepted? (???)

[^consent]: (Quran Al-Nisa:29)

[^injustice]: (Quran Al-Baqarah:279)

[^tainted]: Basede on "Allah has cursed wine, and the one who drinks it, the one who serves it, the one who sells it, the one who buys it, the one who presses it, the one for whom it is pressed, the one who carries it, and the one to whom it is carried."

[^onedirham]: Whoever buys a garment for ten dirhams, and one dirham of it is from unlawful earnings, Allah will not accept his prayer as long as he wears any part of it.

[^flesh]: Every flesh that has grown from unlawful earnings, the Hellfire is more deserving of it.

[^consumeunjustly]: And do not consume one another's wealth unjustly
