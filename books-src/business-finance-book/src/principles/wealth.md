## On being wealthy

Being wealthy[^companions] has its virtues[^grace] [^confirmed] and accountability[^reckoning1] [^reckoning2].

## On managing finances well

Islam encourages
* balanced spending[^balanced]
* entrusting your finances to the right people[^entrust]
* planning for dependents[^dependents]

[^companions]: Examples of wealthy companions: Khadijah bte Khuwallid, Abu Bakar As-Siddiq, Umar ibn Al-Khattab, Uthman ibn Affan

[^grace]: The poor amongst the Muslims who migrated from Makkah to Madinah came to the Prophet pbuh and said "O Messenger of Allah! The possessors of great wealth have obtained the highest ranks in Paradise and the lasting bliss." (Because of their acts of worship, charity and alms-giving). The Prophet pbuh said: This is Allah's grace which He gives to whom He wishes."

[^confirmed]: One of the wealthiest businessmen in his era, Abdul Rahman bin Auf, was given the news of being one of the ten companions who are confirmed to enter Paradise.

[^reckoning1]: I stood at the gate of Paradise and saw that majority of the people who had entered were poor people, while the rich were forbidden (to e nter with the poor, because they were waiting for the reckoning of their accounts).

[^reckoning2]: The poor Muslims will enter Paradise before the rich by half of a day, the length of which is five hundred years.

[^upperhand]: The upper hand is better than the lower one.

[^balanced]: They are those who spend neither wastefully nor stingily, but moderately in between.

[^entrust]: Do not entrust the incapable among your dependants with your wealth which Allah has made a means of support for you, but feed and clothe from it, and speak to them kindly. (Quran Al-Nisa:5)

[^dependents]: It is better for you to leave your heirs wealthy than to leave them poor, begging from people.
(Bukhari, Muslim)
