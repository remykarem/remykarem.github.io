# Wealth

Being wealthy[^companions] has its virtues[^upperhand] [^grace] and accountability[^reckoning1] [^reckoning2].

[^reckoning1]: I stood at the gate of Paradise and saw that majority of the people who had entered were poor people, while the rich were forbidden (to e nter with the poor, because they were waiting for the reckoning of their accounts).

[^reckoning2]: The poor Muslims will enter Paradise before the rich by half of a day, the length of which is five hundred years.

[^upperhand]: The upper hand is better than the lower one.

[^companions]: Examples of wealthy companions: Khadijah bte Khuwallid, Abu Bakar As-Siddiq, Umar ibn Al-Khattab, Uthman ibn Affan

[^grace]: The poor amongst the Muslims who migrated from Makkah to Madinah came to the Prophet pbuh and said "O Messenger of Allah! The possessors of great wealth have obtained the highest ranks in Paradise and the lasting bliss." (Because of their acts of worship, charity and alms-giving). The Prophet pbuh said: This is Allah's grace which He gives to whom He wishes."
