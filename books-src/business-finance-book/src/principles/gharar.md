[^ghararevidence3]: The messenger of Allah pbuh prohibited the sale of fruits until their ripeness and freedom from disease were apparent. He prohibited both the seller and the buyer.

[^ghararevidence4]: Ibn Abbas ra reported that when Allah's prophet pbuh came to Medina, they were paying one and two years in advance for fruits, so he said: Those who pay in advance for anything must do so for a specified weight and for a definite time.
