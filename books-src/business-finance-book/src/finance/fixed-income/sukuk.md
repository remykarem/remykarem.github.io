# Sukuk

A **certificate** that grants the holder a share of an **asset**, where the holder is entitled to regular cash flows based on the underlying asset's performance (rather than based on a fixed interest rate).

Entities (ijara):
* **Issuer** — Business/government
* **Asset** — eg. airport terminal (build, lease)
* **SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle)** — owner or buyer of specific assets; raise capital
  * Raise funds by issuing sukuk to investors
  * Use money to buy the asset
  * Rent out to the govt under a contract
  * Govt makes rental payment ("lease income") to SPV
  * SPV to sukuk holders

~~~admonish question title="What happens when an investor buys a sukuk?"
1. Gain partial **ownership** in the underlying asset.
2. Earn **profits** generated by the underlying asset

Different sukuk structures:
* Lease
* Murabaha
* Mudarabah
* Istisna

~~~admonish warning
Sukuk structures that represent debt (instead of asset ownership) are generally not tradable to avoid riba.
