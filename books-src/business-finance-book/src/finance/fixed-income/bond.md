# Bond

How it works:
* Investor receives regular payments
* Borrower receives lump sum at the end

Components:
* Face Value — Principal loan
* Coupon Rate — how much the borrower receives (per year)
* Yield — market interest rate

~~~admonish note
As market rate increases, coupon rates also need to increase to stay competitive.
~~~

Bond's price is the sum of
* the present value of coupons (regular payments)
* the present value of Face Value at maturity (principal with interest)
