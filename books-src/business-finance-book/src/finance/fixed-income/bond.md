# Bond

How it works:
* Regular payments
* Lump sum at the end

* Face Value — Principal loan
* Coupon Rate — how much the borrower receives (per year)
* Yield — market interest rate

Bond's price is the sum of
* the present value of coupons (regular payments)
* the present value of Face Value at maturity (principal with interest)
