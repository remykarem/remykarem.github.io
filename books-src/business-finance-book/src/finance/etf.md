# ETF

Tradable. Price based on market price.

An ETF is a pooled investment vehicle. It consists of _k_ shares, where each share represents a **fractional ownership** of the fund's total holdings.

~~~admonish info title="Why are ETFs created in the first place?"
* To match the **performance** of indexes, because indexes usually include strong companies
* **Lower cost** — cheaper to manage compared to mutual funds and DIY
* **To minimise risk** — via diversification (usually includes 100s of shares); mutual funds too

Passively managed (because the group of assets don’t really change mich); the fund holds all or most of the same stocks as the index that is being tracked.
