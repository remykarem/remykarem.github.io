# ETF

Tradable. Price based on market price.

An ETF is a pooled investment vehicle. It consists of _k_ shares, where each share represents a **fractional ownership** of the fund's total holdings.

Passively managed (because the group of assets donâ€™t really change mich); the fund holds all or most of the same stocks as the index that is being tracked.
