# Murabahah

Cost-plus sale

Suppose I want to buy a car at $20,000.
1. The bank _buys_ the car from the dealer for $20,000.
2. The bank _sells_ it to you for $23,000, disclosing the $3000 profit the bank will be making.
3. You agree to pay by installments.

~~~admonish question title="Isn't it just interest?"
Paying more than the cash price doesn't mean interest.

* **Linked to real economy** — Interest is a money-for-money transaction, whereas murabahah is an actual sale of an asset.[^evidence]
* **Fairness** — the interest can grow on late payment, not for murabahah.
* **Risk-sharing** — no risk-sharing of the car for interest, but in murabahah there is.
