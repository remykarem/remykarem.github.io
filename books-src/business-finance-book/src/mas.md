Monetary policy management

1. Exchange rate management — price stability
2. Liquidity management — ensure appropriate amount of liquidity in Singapore’s banking system

# Exchange rate management

**Goal: Price stability**

Most central banks target the interest rate.

MAS targets the exchange rate using the S$NEER.

“**Effect of SGD Depreciation on Singapore’s Economy**

With a weaker SGD, the cost of imported manufacturing inputs and consumer goods will be more expensive.”

Weaker SGD means S$1=US$x → S$1=US$(x-ε)

## 1. Metrics

- Foreign exchange markets
- CPII

Considerations of Singapore economy:

- Open
- Small
- Many foreign trading partners
- Heavy dependence on trade

## 2. S$NEER

Singapore Dollar Nominal Effective Exchange Rate — the exchange rate between the Sing dollar and a basket of currencies of the country's major trading partners.

BBC:

- Basket of currencies — add or remove foreign currencies based on trading partners
- Band — “floating point”
    - Adjust the width
    - Adjust the centre
    - Adjust the slope
- Crawl??? — reviews?

Instead of 

S$ 1 = US$ 0.75

we do

S$1 ≈ S$NEER 1 = WeightedAverage(US$ 0.75 + ****AUD 1.1 + ...)

Given

S$NEER 1 = F$ x

then, depreciating means

S$NEER 1 = F$ x-ε

and conversely appreciating means

S$NEER 1 = F$ x+ε

|  | S$NEER | F$ | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Given | 1 | x |  |
| appreciating means | 1 | x + Δ | S$1 can buy more stuff |
| depreciating means | 1 | x - Δ | S$1 buys less stuff |

Now, if we incorporate the “band policy”

|  | S$NEER | F$ | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Given | 1 | x-ϵ < x < x+ϵ |  |
| appreciating means | 1 | x + Δa | S$1 can buy more stuff |
| depreciating means | 1 | x - Δ | S$1 buys less stuff |

appreciating = “trades above x”

## 3. FX

Intervene in FX markets.

If SGD is depreciating, 

i.e. if S$NEER falls below band,

it means there is high supply of SGD,

so we need to reduce the supply of SGD. And this is done by

**purchasing the SGD (”buy back SGD in circulation”, “strengthen SGD”) against the USD**

which means selling USD

which means 

- MAS’ assets OFR will be reduced
- MAS’ liabilitiyies will be reduced, (”reduce banks’ cash balanaces with MAS”)

# Liquidity management

MAS’ liquidity management framework [...] does not manage any level of interest rate or money supply.

Instead, **it aims merely to ensure that there is an appropriate amount of liquidity in the banking system**: sufficient to meet banks’ demand for ...

“Singapore dollar liquidity from the banking system”

**Key players**

- CPF
- AGD
- Banks
- MAS FX intervention
- Currency encashment

**Money market operations**

1. Lending and borrowing. 
2. FX swaps ?
3. SGS bonds
4. MAS bills 

T-bills, Savings Bonds, CMTBs, MAS FRN

Under the Currency Act, each Singapore dollar in circulation must be at least 100% backed by foreign assets.

MAS Treasury / balance sheet (used when we buy or sell SGD in FX)

| Circulation | OFR | OFR | OFR |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Liability | Assets | Assets | Assets |
| S$ | US$ | AUD | MYR |
| 1 | 0.7 | 0.5 | 0.3 |
| 1 | 0.4 | 0.3 | 0.1 |
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 1 |  |  |  |

circulation = banking system = MAS’ liability

OFR = MAS’ assets

In order to maintain price stability, MAS needs to buy and sell USD.

→ this means adding or removing transactions (the above table)

Singapore currency in circulation means citizen’s cold hard cash + citizen’s money in banks + whatever.
