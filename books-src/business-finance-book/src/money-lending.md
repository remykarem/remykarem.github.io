# Loan / money lending

Borrowing money is not wrong[^angelspray].

There is a guideline for borrowing money:
* Written contract [^quran]
* Collateral [^quran]
* Witnesses [^quran]
* Defaulting â€” mercy [^quran, ^hadeeth]
* Demanding more money is riba [^2:275-279]
* Money lending is considered charity

It will be a plus for the borrower to return a little more[^returnmore].
