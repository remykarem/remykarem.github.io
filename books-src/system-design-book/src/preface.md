# Preface

The core concepts of system design are the fundamental building blocks that are used to design, build, and maintain complex systems. Some of the core concepts of system design include:

**Scalability**

**Availability**

**Performance**

Capacity planning: The process of determining the resources needed to support a system, and of ensuring that those resources are available and properly configured.

**Failover and redundancy**: The process of ensuring that a system can continue to operate even if one or more components fail, by having multiple instances of those components, and by automatically switching to a backup instance in the event of a failure.

Monitoring and logging: The process of collecting and analyzing data about the performance and behavior of a system, in order to identify and address problems and to improve the overall performance and reliability of the system.

Security: The process of protecting a system and its data from unauthorized access, modification, or theft.
