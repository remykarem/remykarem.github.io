# Pub/Sub

Publish/Subscribe

~~~admonish note title="Pub/Sub vs Webhook"
* **Decoupling / indirect communication** — Publisher doesn't know about subscribers (there's a message broker). For webhooks, producer needs to know the consumers URL.

* **Many-to-many vs. point-to-point communication** — one message can be received by many subscribers. For webhooks, a message is meant for a consumer.
