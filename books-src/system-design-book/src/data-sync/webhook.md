# Webhook (Push)

aka Push APIs, callback APIs

A webhook is an _integration_ where the server (the system with data) sends ("**pushes**") data to the client (the system which requires the data).

A webhook is an HTTP request (with some payload) triggered by an event in a source system, then sent to a destination system.

Because this is event-triggered, the destination system will get the data (related to that event) in real-time.

A **server**, in the context of webhook, is a system that provides data (in particular, notification).

A webhook shouldn't be compared to an API.

~~~admonish hint
We can see this as the server sends request to client.
