# Scalability

The ability of a system to **adapt to increased or decreased workloads** by adding or removing **resources** efficiently.

~~~admonish note
The keyword here is resource efficiency.

We can put a price tag to the resource, and optimise towards reducing the cost.

Any unused resources count towards the cost.
