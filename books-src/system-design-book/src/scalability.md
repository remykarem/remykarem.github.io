# Scalability

The ability of a system to **adapt to increased or decreased workloads** by adding or removing **resources** efficiently.

~~~admonish note
The keyword here is resource efficiency.

We can put a price tag to the resource, and optimise towards reducing the cost.

Any unused resources count towards the cost.

Scalability is the ability of an application to handle or withstand increased workload without sacrificing latency. Types of scaling:

- Vertical scaling / scaling up: improve hardware
- Horizontal scaling / scaling out: add more hardware

**Cloud elasticity**

Scaling up and down dynamically

**Improving scalability**

- Profiling
- Caching
- CDN
- Data compression
- Avoid unnecessary client-server requests

**Testing scalability**

Run load & stress tests on the system by simulating concurrent traffic
