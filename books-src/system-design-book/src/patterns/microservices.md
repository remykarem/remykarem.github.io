# Microservices

Characteristics

* [Loosely coupled](../strategies/loose-coupling-of-services.md); organised by business capability
* [Database-per-service](../data-management-patterns/database-per-service.md)
* Separate build for each microservice
* Deploy into containers
* Servers are stateless
* DDD
* Microfrontend (?)

Cons:
* It becomes harder to [maintain](../goals/maintainability.md) multiple services.
