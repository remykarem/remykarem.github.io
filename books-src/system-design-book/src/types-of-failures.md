# Types of failures

- Software crashes
- Hardware failures
- Human errors (flawed configurations)
- Planned downtimes
- Transient failures – short-lived failures that typically resolve without any human intervention
  - Temporary network issues
  - Resource contention (eg. CPU momentarily over-utilised)
  - Software glitches – temporary issues (non-critical process crash that resolves quickly)
