# Load balancing

**Distributes** requests across multiple servers.

Load balancing is the process of distributing the load across multiple instances of a component, such as a database or service, in order to improve the [availability](../availability.md) and [scalability](../scalability.md) of the system.

Load balancing algorithms:
* Round Robin
* Weighted Round Robin
* Least Connections
