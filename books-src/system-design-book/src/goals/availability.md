# Availability

**Generic definition**

The ability of a system to remain operational and accessible, even in the face of failures or other disruptions.

**Definition 2**

High availability is the ability of the system to stay online despite having failures at the infrastructural level in real-time.

**CAP theorem definition**

Any request (read or write) received by a non-failing node in a system must result in a response.

_Single point of failure_ is directly tied to poor availability.
