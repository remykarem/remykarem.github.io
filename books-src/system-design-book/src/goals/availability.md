# Availability

The ability of a system to remain operational and accessible, even in the face of failures or other disruptions.

High availability is the ability of the system to stay online despite having failures at the infrastructural level in real-time.

**CAP theorem definition:**

In the event of any node failure,

every request (read or write) **receives a non-error response**.

Otherwise, the system will show an error.
