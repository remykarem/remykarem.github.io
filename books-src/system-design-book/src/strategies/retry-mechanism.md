# Retry mechanism

Retries allow clients to survive random partial failures and short-lived transient failures by sending the same request again.

Helps with:
- [Fault tolerance](../goals/fault-tolerance.md)
- [Reliability](../goals/reliability.md)

Backoff policies
* Fixed backoff / constant backoff / uniform retry interval
* Exponential backoff
* Capped exponential backoff

Why prefer exponential backoff to fixed backoff?
* Reduce network congestion from older requests.
* Reduce server load.
* Prioritise newer requests (in the case of a queue) possibly due to transient errors. Older requests are possibly due to application error; so we allow some time to recover.
* Avoid synchronisation risk.
* Helps with [scalability](../goals/scalability.md) as the workload increases â€” at any point of time given _m_ messages, we retry _k_ recent requests (where $k \le m$) vs. at any point of time we retry $k = m$ messages

Characteristics of a policy:
- Count: How many more times to retry?
- Frequency: Exponential backoff
- Randomness: Jitter can prevent synchronised retries
- Selective: Not all failures should be retried. For example, 4xx is usually because of the request itself.
