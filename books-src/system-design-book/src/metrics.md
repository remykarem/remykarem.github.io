# Metrics

* **IOPS** — input/output per second

* **Throughput** — rate of processing; the rate at which a system processes data or completes tasks

  TPS (transactions per second), Mbps (megabits per second)

* **Bandwidth** — _maximum_ amount of data that can be transmitted over a network in a given amount of time

  Mbps

* **Latency** — the amount of time a system takes to respond to a user request. It is usually divided into 2 parts:

  - Network latency
  - Application latency

* **Resource usage**
    * CPU
    * Memory
    * Disk I/O
    * Network bandwidth

* **Response time**
