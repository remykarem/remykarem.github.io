Offers:
* Decentralised generation
* Global uniqueness
* Less guessable than sequential IDs

Features:
* **Temporal information**
* **Sequential**
  ~~~admonish question title="Why do we want sequential?"
  Helps with data locality in the database
  ~~~
* Privacy issues (MAC address)

~~~admonish question title="UUIDv7's risk of collision is lower than UUIDv4?"
A Redditor [says](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/s/iufhhOQPAd) the risk of collision is reduced for UUIDs created close in time to each other.
