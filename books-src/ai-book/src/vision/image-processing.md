# Image processing

* Gaussian blur — reduces noise and detail
* Edge detection — highlights boundaries (eg. Canny edge detector)
* Contrast adjustment
* Histogram equalisation — improves contrast
* Binary thresholding
* Adaptive thresholding — thresholding based on the local neighbourhood of a pixel
* Morphological transformations
  * Erosion — removes white noise, detach two connnected in an image
  * Dilation – fills in gaps
  * Opening (erosion then dilation)
  * Closing (dilation then erosion)
* Line detection (eg. Hough transform)
