# Digital signal processing

Terminologies

- Bit depth
    
    How many different values that can be recorded. 8/16/32/64-bit
    
- Sampling rate = sample frequency
    
    No of readings per second. 44.1kHz (CD Quality audio), 48, 96kHz
    
- Bit rate
    
    No. Of bits encoded per sample per second. Bits per second. 64-128 kbps
    
    Bits per sample x samples per second x no. of channels
    
- Bandwidth
    
    Speed at which you can transmit data.
    
- Channels
    
    1 = mono. 2 = stereo.
    
    librosa automatically combines into mono
    
- File size
    
    Bit rate x duration / 8
    
    Formats
    
    Aac
    
    Mo3
    
    Wav - uncompressed
