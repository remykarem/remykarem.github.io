# GAN

Generative Adversarial Network

Instead of explicitly modelling the density (distribution of data), we just sample to generate new instances. However, we canâ€™t sample from complex distribution directly. Thus the solution is to sample from something simple (noise), **learn a transformation** to the training distribution.

```admonish note
We also cannot measure the difference of the generated samples with training samples because it's too expensive.
```

Adversaries (neural networks): 

- The generator turns noise into an imitation of the data
- The discriminator tries to discern between a fake generated by the generator and the true data.

Uses:

* Style transfer: CycleGAN
