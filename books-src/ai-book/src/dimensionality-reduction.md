# Dimensionality reduction

to create embeddings or projection of high-dimensional vector to 3D

(unsupervised learning)

Dimensionality reduction. Reducing the dimension helps us to visualise better

PCA - keep global distance

t-SNE - focus on local distance

UMAP - focus on local distance, but keep more global distance

Random projection

Runtime: tSNE>UMAPâ‰¥PCA
