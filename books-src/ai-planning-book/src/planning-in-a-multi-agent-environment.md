# Planning in a multi-agent environment

We use game theory to model an environment with agents who make rational decisions.

Each player tries to maximise its own expected utility ("**rational agent**")

How do you maximise utility knowing that every other player is also maximising utility?

Uncertainty comes from decisions of other players

"once you enter an equilibrium, you won't want to switch"

> ğŸ’¡ Rational players will go for Nash equilibrium. If you're not at equilibrium, there will be one player who can outdo you.

> ğŸ’¡ A solution means to find strategies for each person so that an equilibrium is achieved
