# Counting

If there are $n$ positions and $k$ cars, how many different possible combinations will there be if multiple cars can be at the same position?

**Ans**: This means that every car can take $n$ different positions.

```
car1 [1,2,...,n]
car2 [1,2,...,n]
...
cark [1,2,...,n]
```

So there will be $n^k$ different combinations.
