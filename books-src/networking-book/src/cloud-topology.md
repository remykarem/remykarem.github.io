## Subnet

it only handles the inbound responses from those outbound requests. 

## Virtual Private Gateway

Any subnets created within this VPC can either be associated with either

* a **custom route table**

## VPC peering

A network connection between two VPCs.

New routes should be added to the VPC's route table to specify which traffic should traverse the peering connection.

## Network ACL

## Security group

A security group defines inbound and outbound rules.

One or more security groups can be attached to an [ENI](#eni).

## Resource

An Elastic Network Interface is associated with a [resource](#resource). More than one ENIs can be attached to an instance. 

An ENI is automatically created for every EC2 instance.

An ENI is similar to a virtual network interface â€” it has attributes like private IP address etc.
