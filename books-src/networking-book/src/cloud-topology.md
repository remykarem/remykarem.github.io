New routes should be added to the VPC's route table to specify which traffic should traverse the peering connection.

## Security group

## Instance / resource

## ENI

An Elastic Network Interface is associated with an instance. More than one ENIs can be attached to an instance. 

An ENI is automatically created for every EC2 instance.

An ENI is similar to a virtual network interface â€” it has attributes like private IP address etc. It also has a **security group**.

## Network Firewall

Both incoming and outgoing

## WAF (Web Application Firewall)
