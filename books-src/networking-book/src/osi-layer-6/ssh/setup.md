# Setup

For this protocol to work, these things need to be set up first.

## For server authentication ("host authentication")

~~~admonish note
These keys should be automatically created when installing SSH on the server (?), so no generation is required.
~~~

A private key, held by the server, is used for host authentication. It is typically stored in the server's `/etc/ssh`.

~~~admonish info title="Host key algorithms"
These are the algorithms that the server will advertise to the client for host authentication.

This can be RSA, ECDSA, ED25519 etc.

This value can be set as the `HostKeyAlgorithms` configuration.
~~~

The public key is shared with the client _during the initial connection_. The client then stores this key typically in `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.

~~~admonish warning title="Trust On First Use"
The server should ideally share this public key with the clients _out-of-band_ prior to any SSH connections.

Otherwise, the client is left to blindly trust the server on first connection. The client is then susceptible to MITM attack.

What's a good practice then? Out-of-band.

1. Get the host fingerprint out-of-band.

2. Connect to the SSH.

3. When it prompts for

    ```
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
    ```

    paste the fingerprint instead of typing `yes` or `no`.

GitHub, on the other hand, does it this way: [GitHub SSH key fingerprints](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints)

We could also do `ssh-keyscan [hostname]` but there is still a MITM risk.
~~~

## User account

A username needs to be associated for every connection.

To create an account, a user account needs to be created in the Linux system itself.

## For client authentication

The private key, held by the client, is used for authenticating with the server.

The public key, should be shared with the server out-of-band prior to any SSH connection. This is typically stored in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` at the server.

There is an option to encrypt the private key at rest, which requires a passphrase.

~~~admonish info title="Accepted public key cryptography algorithms"
Both the server and the client can specify the public key algorithms it accepts and is willing to use (respectively).

This can be done via the `PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms` configuration.
~~~

~~~admonish info title="Passphrase and ssh-agent"
`ssh-agent` is a program that assists with passphrase-protected private keys (in memory) so that the user doesn't have to type in the passphrase every time the key is needed.

The `AddKeysToAgent` and `UseKeychain` SSH configs are associated with this SSH agent.

~~~

~~~admonish note title="Other client authentication methods"
Apart from asymmetric key pair, other authentication methods include:
- Password â€” the password is encrypted using the shared secret key
- SSH certificates

The client authentication can also be two-factor.
~~~

~~~admonish tip title="Test connection"
To test connection to the server, the client can do

```
ssh -T <hostname>
```
~~~

## Other user configurations

User configurations are typically stored at `~/.ssh/config`:

```config
Host examplehostname
    HostName example.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/example_private_key
    User raimi
    Port 11566
```

## Other system configurations

System configurations are typically stored at `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`.

More information can be found in

```
man ssh_config
```
