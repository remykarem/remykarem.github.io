# DHCP

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

DHCP provides **network configurations** to its client:
* IP address
* Subnet mask
* Default gateway
* DNS servers

When a device wants to join a network and needs an IP address, the device sends a request to the DHCP server which includes the device's MAC address.
