# Open-closed principle

The goal of this principle is to try as much as possible to not modify the existing code.

This will [minimise the risks of integrity of existing code](../goals/minimise-bugs.md) when new features are added.

This in turn reduces the potential for bugs and regression issues.

“Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.”

~~~admonish tip
This is like asking "how can you change your code without modifying existing code?"
