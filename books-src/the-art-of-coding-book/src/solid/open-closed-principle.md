# Open-closed principle

The goal of this principle is to try as much as possible to not modify the existing code.

This will [minimise the risks of introducing bugs](../goals/minimise-bugs.md) when new features are added.

“Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.”

~~~admonish tip
This is like asking "how can you change your code without modifying existing code?"
