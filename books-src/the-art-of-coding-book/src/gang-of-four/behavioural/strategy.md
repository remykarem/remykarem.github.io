# Strategy

Used when you have different algorithms or approaches or classes or ways (known as **"strategies"**) to achieve the same operation. 

You'll need:
* the **Strategy interface**

  ```kotlin
  interface Operation {
    fun calculate(a: Int, b: Int): Int
  }
  ```
  
* the different **concrete Strategy implementations** of this interface

  ```kotlin
  class Add: Operation {
    fun calculate(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
      return a + b
    }
  }

  class Subtract: Operation {
    fun calculate(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
      return a - b
    }
  }
  ```
  
* the **context class** that will use the Strategies â€” this class's has several purposes:
  * to decouple the _implementation details_ of the Strategies from the client code
  * to encapsulate the _strategy selection_, and by extension help to choose the right strategy. 
 
  ```kotlin
  class Calculator(
    operation: Strategy
  ) {
    fun setStrategy(strategy: Strategy)
    fun calculate(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
      return operation.calculate(a, b)
    }
  }
  ```
  
* the **client code**

You can easily add more strategies without modifying the existing classes, adhering to the open-closed principle.

## Enum pattern vs strategy interface

Perhaps for simpler strategies, an enum pattern would also work.

"Simple" here could easily be quantified by number of lines of code. 

Because it's an enum, there will be a lot of matching on the self object.

```rust
enum Strategy {
    Add,
    Subtract,
    Multiply,
}

impl Strategy {
    fn apply(&self, a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
        match self {
            Strategy::Add => a + b,
            Strategy::Subtract => a - b,
            Strategy::Multiply => a * b,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let strategy = Strategy::Add;
    let result = strategy.apply(5, 3);
    println!("Result: {}", result);
}
```
