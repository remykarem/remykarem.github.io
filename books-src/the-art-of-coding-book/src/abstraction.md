# Abstraction

By depending on abstract types (like interfaces) instead of concrete types, you can reduce the coupling between different parts of a program, making it more flexible and easier to change and maintain.

Leaky abstraction â€” when the underlying complexities "leak through," causing unexpected behaviors or requiring the developer to have knowledge of the underlying details to use it correctly.
