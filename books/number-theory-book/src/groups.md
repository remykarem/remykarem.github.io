# Groups

A group $\mathbb{G}$ is a set of elements that follows the following rules:

* **Closure**
* **Associativity**
* **Identity**
* **Invertability**

The number of elements of the group, $|\mathbb{G}|$, is known as the **order of the group**.

Groups may have:

* generators — a group can have either several or no generators.
* subgroups

Groups can be:
* finite or infinite
* **cyclic** — if a group has generator(s)

Elements of a group can:
* repeat
* have an **element order**
