# Multiplicative groups modulo $m$

A "multiplicative" group is a group whose arithmetic operations between elements involve multiplications (one or many).

The multiplicative group of integers modulo $m$ is denoted by $\mathbb{Z}_m^\times$.

```admonish question
Why must a number be coprime to the group's modulus in order for it to have an inverse?
```

Euler's totient function Ï†(n) is related to the order of the multiplicative group modulo p, where p is a prime number.
