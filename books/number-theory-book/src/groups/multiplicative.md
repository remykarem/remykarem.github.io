# Multiplicative groups

A "multiplicative" group is a group whose arithmetic operations between elements involve multiplications (one or many).

```admonish example title="Example 1"
The set of real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$.
```

```admonish example title="Example 2"
The multiplicative group of integers modulo $m$ is denoted by $\mathbb{Z}_m^\times$.
```

```admonish example title="Counter-example 1"
The set of integers, $\mathbb{Z}$, does not form a multiplicative group. This is because the inverse of the elements are not integers.
```

```admonish question
Why must a number be coprime to the group's modulus in order for it to have an inverse?
```

Euler's totient function Ï†(n) is related to the order of the multiplicative group modulo p, where p is a prime number.
