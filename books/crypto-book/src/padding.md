# Padding

Padding is an algorithm that ensures data aligns with the specific block size requirements.

Padding schemes might also provide a security measure against certain types of cryptanalysis e.g. by adding randomness.

Here are some common padding schemes:

- **OAEP** â€” Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding

    This is commonly used with RSA.

- **PKCS#7** 

    Commonly used by algorithms like AES.
