~~~admonish example title="Spring Boot: FilterChain"
An HTTP request is passed through a series of filters ("filter chain") before rreaching the destination controller.

This is an example of the Chain of Responsibility pattern beacuase it allows the filterrs to be organised in a chain. Each filter has the ability to either handle the request or pass it along.

A common idiom is

```kotlin
chain.doFilter
```
