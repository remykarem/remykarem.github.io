# Storage management

Types of storage: *disk-based*, *RAM-based*

This book refers to disk-based storage.

Data can be in:
* Disk
* RAM

The topic on storage of data is closely related to [access methods](../query/query_processing/access_methods.md) because at the end of the day, data needs to be accessed.
