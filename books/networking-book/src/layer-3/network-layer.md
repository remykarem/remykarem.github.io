# Layer 3 - Network (Internet)

IP: “You're not supposed to be here!”

Responsibilities:

- Host addressing
- Message forwarding: Since many networks are partitioned into subnetworks and connect to other networks for wide-area communications, networks use specialised hosts, called gateways or routers, to forward packets between networks.
