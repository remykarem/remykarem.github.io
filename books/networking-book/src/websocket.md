# WebSocket

[RFC 6455](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455)

A WebSocket connection is preferred when we need a persistent bi-directional ("**full duplex**") low latency data flow from the client to the server and back. The connection is open for as long as we want. Eg. chat apps, real-time social streams, browser-based multiplayer games.
