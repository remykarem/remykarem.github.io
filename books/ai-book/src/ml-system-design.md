## 0. **Overview**

Intelligence = can process information, and inform future decisions

- AI: Make machines solve problems associated with human intelligence. Anything that can make computers mimic human behaviour
- Machine Learning: Make machines learn (from experience) instead of explicit programming
- Deep Learning: Make machines extract information / patterns using neural networks

## **1. Project setup / problem framing**

- Motivation
    - What is the current pain point?
- Goals
    - What do you want to achieve with this problem?
- Background information
- Definitions
- End-user experience
    - A walkthrough of how end users are supposed to use the system.
- Performance constraints (speed & accuracy)
    - How good & fast must the prediction be?
        - High-frequency trading requires very fast predictions
        - What‚Äôs more important - precision or recall?
        - What‚Äôs more costly: FN or FP?
- Evaluation
    - What metrics do you use to evaluate your system during training and inference?
- Project constraints
    - Hardware
    - Working environment
- Developer tools
    - Workflow orchestration
        - Luigi
        - Airflow
    - Experiment management
        - Tensorboard
        - MLFlow
        - Weights & Biases
- Foresight
    - What is the final environment in which the code will be run?
    - Where would you see the model in 5 years?

## **2. Data collection**

- Data sources
    - Open source
    - Data augmentation (CV)
    - Synthetic data (esp. NLP)
- Data collection
    - Data okay? Is the data noisy? Need to go back to client? Limitations? Features you think you can get from client?
    - Questions you might ask the client
    - Interesting things you did not find
    - Potential bias?
- Data storage
    - Database (eg. Postgres)
    - Object store. Stores binary data (eg. S3)
    - Data lake. Aggregates features not obtainable from database like logs
    - Feature store. Stores ML features (eg. FEAST, Michaelangelo)
- Representation
- Challenges
    - Distribution
    - Privacy
    - Biases

## **3. Exploration**

[Data visualisation](https://www.notion.so/Data-visualisation-1db4e8e621844ea2a73a521ff3379393)

- Clustering
- Dimensionality reduction

## **4. Preprocessing**

Feature engineering

Feature transformation

Feature selection

Train-test split

- **Improving speed** üì¶
- Scaling*
    - Model parallelism
    - Data parallelism

    - **Bias and variance**üß™^

## **6. Reporting / documentation**

- **Explainability, interpretability & biasness**üß™
    - Feature importance
- Evaluation metrics
- Inference speed
- Model confidence
- Misuses
- Ablation studies
- Visualisations

## **7. Production & code**

- Data
    - Continual collection
    - Versioning
        - DVC
        - Pachyderm
- Software
    - Correctness of code
- Production environment
- Model
    - Outdated - retrain
    - Biased - need to train with data privacy
    
- Tests

## **Client speak**

I want 5% more accuracy

- Maybe we can look at a different metric
- What does 5% mean to the business?
- ‚ÄúI want 100% accuracy.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI want to increase accuracy.‚Äù
