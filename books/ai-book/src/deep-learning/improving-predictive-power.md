- Progressive resizing

- Mixup augmentation

- Removing wrongly classified test images

- Ensembling

- Model Fine-tuning using discriminative learning rate etc
- Model distillation: large models or ensembles of models may be distilled into a single, smaller model

Progressive Labelling

MixMatch

Cutout regularisation. Zero out a random 8x8 square subset of an image.
