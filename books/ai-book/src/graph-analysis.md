## Community detection

Note that data is a tuple of $(V,E)$ (undirected?). (In usual clustering task with no edges, these graphs are called "trivial graphs")

Partition network such that

1. inter-group edges are sparse
2. intra-group edges are dense

### Hierarchical clustering

Define similarity between nodes

- no. of node disjoint paths ???
- no. of edge disjoint paths ???
- ...

$O(|V|^3)$?

Problem

### Girvan-Newman algorithm

Hierarchical divisive method. 

1. Start with whole graph
2. Find edge whose removal will partition the graph. Use edge betweenness.
3. Repeat until single nodes

Edge betweenness 

$$
B(a,b) = \frac{\text{no. of shortest paths that pass through a and b}}{\text{no. of shortest paths}}
$$

is a measure of edge importance, i.e. how important an edge is in keeping the graph connected such that if we cut this edge, it makes a lot of difference and will create more meaningful partitions. 

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ An inter-community edge has a higher betweenness than an intra-community edge.

Algorithm to compute edge betweenness

Time complexity $O(|E|^2|V|)$

1. For a vertex, calculate betweenness of every edge $O(|E|)$.
2. Final score $O(|V|)$.
3. Remove the edge with the highest betweenness.
4. Repeat for the other edges. $O(|E|)$.

## Ranking

Goal is to rank the nodes in a directed graph $(V,E)$.
