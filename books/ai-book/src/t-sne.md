**#nonparametric**

t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (2008)

- Unsupervised non-linear technique
- Things that are close remain close (?)
- preserving only small pairwise distances or local similarities
- Perplexity ~ a guess about the number of close neighbours each point has. 5-50
- Creates 2D maps from multidimensional data
- More computationally expensive
