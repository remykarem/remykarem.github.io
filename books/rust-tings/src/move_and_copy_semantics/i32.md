# i32

Life is much easier for types that implement the `Copy` trait, like [`i32`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.i32.html#).

### ✅ Listing 2-1

Again, let's start with something simple. We create `age` and call `do_something` with it. Here, the value of `age` is copied, because the `i32` type implements the `Copy` trait.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let age: i32 = 25;
    do_something(age);
}

fn do_something(age: i32) {
    println!("Hello, {}!", age);
}
```

### ✅ Listing 2–2

The value of `age` is copied again in Line 4.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let age: i32 = 25;
    do_something(age);
    println!("{}", age);
}

fn do_something(age: i32) {
    println!("Hello, {}!", age);
}
```

### ✅ Listing 2–3

We can also pass the value by reference, although *I think* it is not idiomatic.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let age: i32 = 25;
    do_something(&age);
    println!("{}", age);
}

fn do_something(age: &i32) {
    println!("Hello, {}!", age);
}
```

### ✅ ⚠️ Listing 2–4

In Line 3, we first cloned `age` before passing it to `do_something`. The program compiles, but note that the copying will be done twice - one in `.clone()`, the other is the copying when `age` goes into `do_something` scope.

Note that this idiom should be avoided. See Clippy lint on **clone_on_copy** [here](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#clone_on_copy).

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let age: i32 = 25;
    do_something(age.clone());
    println!("{}", age);
}

fn do_something(age: i32) {
    println!("Hello, {}!", age);
}
```
