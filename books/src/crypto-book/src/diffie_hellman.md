# DH

## DHKE

The Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange (**DH** or **DHKE**) method allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel.

* Concepts
    * Primitive root modulo
    * Multiplicative group of integers modulo
    * Modular exponentation
* Trapdoor function: modular exponentaition?
* DHKE problem: discrete logarithm problem

Define secret \\( s \\) and an agreed modulo \\( p \\) (which is prime):

$$
s = s \bmod p \\\\
$$

Letting \\( s = g^{ab} \\), where \\( g \\) is a primitive root modulo \\( p \\), we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
g^{ba} \bmod p &= g^{ab} \bmod p \\\\
(g^b \bmod p)^a \bmod p &= (g^a \bmod p)^b \bmod p \\\\
\end{aligned}
$$

Let \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) be secrets that are individually chosen by Alice and Bob respectively. LHS: Alice's computation, RHS: Bob's computation.

$$
(g^{b_{secret}} \bmod p)^{a_{secret}} \bmod p = (g^{a_{secret}} \bmod p)^{b_{secret}} \bmod p
$$

Looking at Alice's computation, she would need to compute \\( (g^{b_{secret}} \bmod p) \\). However, this can be provided by Bob because Bob owns \\( b_{secret} \\). So now we have:

$$
(b_{public})^{a_{secret}} \bmod p = (g^{a_{secret}} \bmod p)^{b_{secret}} \bmod p
$$

Repeating the same for the other:

$$
(b_{public})^{a_{secret}} \bmod p = (a_{public})^{b_{secret}} \bmod p
$$
