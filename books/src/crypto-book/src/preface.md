# Goals

"item" = document, message, password

Integrity — proof that the item is not altered

Authenticity/authentication — proof that the item comes from a known source

Confidentiality/Privacy/secrecy — no one can read (and understand) the message in the item

Symmetry — if there is content encryption, is the same key used for both encryption and decryption?

Randomisation - if there is content encryption, will the same plaintext yield different ciphertexts?

Non-repudiation — the signer cannot deny that they signed (because...?)

Resistant to attacks — the item cannot be easily guessed
