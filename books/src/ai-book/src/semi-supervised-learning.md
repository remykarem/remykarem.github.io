# Semi-supervised learning

# **Semi-supervised learning**

Small amount of data and large amount of unlabelled data.

# **Weak supervision**

Labelled data are noisy and imprecise.

Workflow

1. Process unlabelled data to generate accuracies of label sources
2. Generate training labels
3. Train a powerful model

# **Frameworks**

Snorkel: aggregate noisy labelling function outputs to automatically label training data
