Distance-Based Learning

- Examples
    - By class
        - Positive
        - Negative
    - By model training
        - Hard
        - Soft
- Mining (Hard Mining)
    - Online (while training model)
    - Offline (before? training model)

**Positives / Positive Examples**

A pair of examples from the same class

**Negatives / Negative Examples**

A pair of examples from different class

**Hard Mining**

Finding the relevant examples that can train the model (non-zero gradient)

**Hard Examples**

Examples that cause the model to train (non-zero gradient)

**Hard Negative Mining**

Finding negatives that cause the model to train (non-zero gradient)

**Hard Positive Mining**

Finding positives that cause the model to train (non-zero gradient)

**Hard Positives**

Positives that cause the model to train (non-zero gradient)

**Hard Negatives**Â 

Negatives that cause the model to train (non-zero gradient)

**Offline Hard Mining**

Hard mining before training model

**Online Hard Mining**

Hard mining while training model
