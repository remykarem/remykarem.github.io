# Characteristics of learning

- Greedy
- GLIE (Greedy in the Limit with Infinite Exploration)
    - Policy must try each action in each state an unbounded no. of times
    - Policy will must eventually become greedy
- On-policy or off-policy learning
    - On-policy: data used for learning generated by the policy being learned
    - Off-policy: maybe we don't want to disrupt the policy being learned with new data, so we use another policy
        - Behaviour policy \\( b \\): currently in operation
        - Target policy \\( \pi \\): policy to learn
