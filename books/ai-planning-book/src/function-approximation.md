# Function approximation

Often done by learning from data (hence in this appendix).

State to action

$$
f(s) \rightarrow a
$$

State to value

$$
f(s) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

Function approximation **approximates utility function** as a function of state variables.

$$
U(s) \approx f(s) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 s_1 + ...
$$
