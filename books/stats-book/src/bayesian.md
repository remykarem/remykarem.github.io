# Bayesian

To form accurate beliefs, you always start from the information you already have. You update beliefs. You donâ€™t discard everything you know.

Marginal probability: Probability of an event irrespective of other event outcomes

$$
p(x)
$$

Joint probability

$$
p(x,y)
$$

Conditional probability

$$
p(x|y)
$$

### Bayes Theorem

[https://neilkakkar.com/Bayes-Theorem-Framework-for-Critical-Thinking.html](https://neilkakkar.com/Bayes-Theorem-Framework-for-Critical-Thinking.html)

$$
\text{posterior odds} = \text{prior odds} \times \text{likelihood odds}
$$

$$
= \frac{P()}{1}
$$

$$
posterior = \frac{likelihood * prior}{evidence}
$$

$$
P(H|E)=\frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}
$$

$$
p(y|x)=\frac{p(x|y) \times p(y)}{p(x)}
$$

```admonish note
ðŸ’¡ To contrast Bayesian is to take only the evidence as the complete truth.

believe in something â†’ get evidence â†’ calculate likelihood â†’ update belief

### 1. Believe in something

Quantify with

-

### 2. Get evidence

```admonish note
ðŸ’¡ Always seek disconfirming evidence to avoid confirmation bias.
```

### 3. Calculate likelihood

### 4. Update
