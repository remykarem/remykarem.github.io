# 2-player non-zero-sum games

### **2-player games (non-zero sum)**

- Pure strategy
    
    For each player, remove pure strategies that are strictly dominated by another pure strategy. Then see if there is a strategy profile left.
    
    > üí° No Nash equilibrium can involve a strictly dominated strategy. So it should be removed.
    
    > ‚ö†Ô∏è Nash equilibrium may not exist.
    
- Mixed strategy

    Assign a probability of choosing an action for the 2 players with $p$ and $q$ respectively. Find the solution where utilities for selcting every action is the same.
