- Missing values
    - Fill using information from correlation
    - Fill using group information
    - Fill via knowledge (search)
    - Fill via heuristics (how a value is obtained in the real world)
- Importance of visualisation in the right angle
- Distribution of a feature with hue=(train, test)
- Remarks
- Engineering features based on *information gain* (against target).
- High cardinality indicates that a lot of feature engineering can be done. Convert high cardinality to count. (Is it always okay?)
- Create a feature that is your own proxy of the target variable.
