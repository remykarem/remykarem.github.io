# Ring

A **ring** consists of a set $R$ and both *addition* and *multiplication* operations.

|                | Addition | Multiplication |
|----------------|----------|----------------|
| Closure        | ✅       | ✅             |
| Associativity  | ✅       | ✅             |
| Identity       | ✅       | ✅             |
| Invertibility  | ✅       |                |
| Commutativity  | ✅       |                |
| Distributivity | -        | ✅             |

Addition forms a commutative group, multiplication forms a monoid, and multiplication distributes over addition.
