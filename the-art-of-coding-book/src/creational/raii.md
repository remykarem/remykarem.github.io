# RAII

Resource Acquisition Is Initialization

```admonish example title="C++"
(Originated from C++.)
```

```admonish example title="Kotlin"
Kotlin has a `use` function to the `Closeable` interface.

Using this idiom follows the RAII pattern as it cleans up the resource as soon as we're done with them.
